# Production Planning Under Uncertainty

## Project Overview
This project addresses production planning, focusing on improving medium-term planning by integrating capacity constraints and addressing production system as well as demand uncertainty. It enhances traditional Material Requirements Planning (MRP) by incorporating simulation-based and optimization-based approaches to create production plans that align with real-world conditions.

## Description
The provided simulation model is capable of parameterizing a multi-item, multi-stage production system using an SQLite database. Results and parameterizations are either stored in the SQLite database per simulation instance run on a computer or in a central PostgreSQL installation.
